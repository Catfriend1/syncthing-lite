# Roadmap

## What should happen

- fixing bugs and crashs
  - just create a issue WITH a detailed crash report (not: it does not work)
  - search if there is an other issue for it before creating a new one
- add option to manually select the IP address of an device (<https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-lite/issues/25>)
- allow custom discovery servers or disabling device discovery (<https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-lite/issues/105>)
- downloading all files of an folder (<https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-lite/issues/34>)
- better server offline handling (<https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-lite/issues/63>)
- file uploading support (it currently does not work) <https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-lite/issues/70>
