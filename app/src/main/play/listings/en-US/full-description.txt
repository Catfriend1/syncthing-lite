⚡ Revival of the app which was abandoned years ago. Let's discuss it on [Syncthing-Forum](https://forum.syncthing.net/).

✅ Safety warning: Please always ensure that you have backed up your data by other means and that this backup is up to date before using this app. The app is still in early development.

⚠️ We assume no liability for data corruption or loss, although we make every effort to deliver quality.

This project is an Android app, that works as a client for a Syncthing share (accessing Syncthing devices in the same way a client-server file sharing app access its proprietary server).

This is a client-oriented implementation, designed to work online by downloading and uploading files from an active device on the network instead of synchronizing a local copy of the entire repository. This is quite different from the way the Syncthing-Fork app works, and its useful from those devices that cannot or wish not to download the entire repository (for example, mobile devices with limited storage available, wishing to access a syncthing share).
